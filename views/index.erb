<div id="introduction">
  <p>The Scholars' Lab GIS workshop sessions are designed to be accessible without prior knowledge or experience with GIS software and to give attendees hands-on experience with step-by-step instructions. Workshop topics are based on the how-to questions Kelly and Chris answer daily in their interactions with faculty and students in the Scholarsâ€™ Lab, in addition to emerging themes in geospatial scholarship.</p>
